# Musicians_Together_Strong
A hub for musicians to find shows, gear, and other like-minded. It puts music at the forefront in discovering other musicians by letting you upload songs. It incorporates a google maps and geocoder api to help you better find gear sellers near you. Last but not least, find shows with discrete flyers within the web page and connect with people in person. All the information you'd need is available!

Instead of sifting through random craigslist posts to start a band, use this application instead!

Created with react, redux and some bootstrap for the styling.
